First Homework of the Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning course is about image classification with convolutional neural networks. 


The task is a image classification problem on the proposed dataset. In particular, you are required to classify images depicting groups of people based on the number of masked people. In the specific, your solution must discriminate between images depending on the following cases: 1) All the people in the image are wearing a mask, 2) No person in the image is wearing a mask, 3) Someone in the image is not wearing a mask.

Thus, the classification is performed on 3 different classes. Being a classification problem, given an image, the goal is to predict the correct class label.
