Second Homework of the Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning course is about image segmentation.

In this competition, ACRE organizers ask you to segment RGB images to distinguish between crop, weeds, and background. ACRE is the Agri-food Competition for Robot Evaluation, part of the METRICS project funded by the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 871252.

Automatic crop and weed segmentation can be a driver of innovations to optimize the agricultural processes. Indeed, automatic weed detection can be exploited by a ground robot for mechanical weeding. Thus, pesticides could even be completely avoided.
