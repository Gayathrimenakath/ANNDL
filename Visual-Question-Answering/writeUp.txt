We used CNN+RNN , the pretrained models used were Xception,VGG19,InceptionResNetV2 with adam and RMSProp optimizers.
We used the learning rates, 0.001,0.0001,0.0002,0.00001
We got the best output for InceptionResNetV2 using adam. RMSProp also gave similar results of accuracy 0.44.
InceptionResNetV2, optimizer= adam and learning rate =1e^-4
We also tried adding few dense layers along with dropout in the CNN.
We also used bidirectional LSTM layers.

When we tried using 3 layer of LSTM to encode questions. This gave us an accuracy of 0.39.
