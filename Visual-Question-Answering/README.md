Third homework is about visual question answering and it mixes feature extraction from images and text in order to solve an multi domain classification task.

The task is to solve a visual question answering (VQA) problem on the proposed dataset. The dataset is composed by synthetic scenes, in which people and objects interact, and by corresponding questions, which are about the content of the images. 

Given an image and a question, the goal is to provide the correct answer. Answers belong to 3 possible categories: 'yes/no', 'counting' (from 0 to 5) and 'other' (e.g. colors, location, ecc.) answers.
